PROJECT:Building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data using bank marketing dataset 

Project Objectives:
Predict Customer Purchase: Develop a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Data Analysis: Analyze the bank marketing dataset to understand the key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the decision tree classifier using appropriate metrics.

Key Methodologies:
Data Collection: Import the bank marketing dataset from a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for the model.

Model Building: Develop a decision tree classifier.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Techniques:
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values.

Remove or impute outliers.

Convert categorical variables to numerical if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics.

Visualization of distributions and relationships.

Feature Selection:

Identify and select the most relevant features for the model.

Model Building:

Develop a decision tree classifier using the selected features.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Here's a basic template to get you started:

python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the bank marketing dataset
df = pd.read_csv('bank_marketing.csv')

# Data Cleaning
# Handle missing values
df.fillna(df.median(), inplace=True)

# Convert categorical variables to numerical
df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Visualization
# Bar chart for job distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='job', data=df)
plt.title('Job Distribution')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()

# Histogram for age distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(df['age'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()

# Feature Selection
# Select relevant features
features = df.drop('y', axis=1)
target = df['y']

# Model Building
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the decision tree classifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model Evaluation
# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='yes')
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='yes')
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, pos_label='yes')
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Precision: {precision}')
print(f'Recall: {recall}')
print(f'F1 Score: {f1}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')
